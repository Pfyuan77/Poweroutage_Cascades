# WP2_ARIO_EconLoss – Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and model implementation in WP2.  
Each notebook addresses a distinct research question within the ARIO framework.

## Contents

### 1. ARIO_total_loss_UK_2001-2027.ipynb
- **Purpose**:  
  Computes cascading economic losses across all NUTS2 regions and sectors in the UK, covering both historical outages (2001–2022) and future scenarios (2023–2027).  
- **Outputs**:  
  - Regional and sectoral loss estimates in million euros.  
  - Time series of aggregated economic losses.  
- **Use**:  
  Provides the baseline loss dataset for cross-WP analyses and visualisation.  

### 2. ARIO_unit_loss_vs_duration.ipynb
- **Purpose**:  
  Examines the relationship between outage duration and unit economic loss, including mul-regional and multi-time cascading outages.  
- **Outputs**:  
  - Unit loss functions by duration.  
  - Comparative metrics across sectors, regions, and temporal scales.  
- **Use**:  
  <!-- Supports sensitivity analysis and policy-relevant interpretation of how outage severity translates into disproportionate losses.   -->
