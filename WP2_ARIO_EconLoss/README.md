# WP2_ARIO_EconLoss

This work package quantifies cascading economic losses from power outages using an Adaptive Input–Output (ARIO) model.

## Structure
- `data/` : Input–output tables, outage scenarios.  
- `notebooks/` : Exploratory notebooks for model testing and calibration.  
- `scripts/` : Python scripts to run ARIO simulations and sensitivity analyses.  
- `results/` : Estimated sectoral and regional economic losses.  

## Purpose
To capture short- and long-term disruptions across supply chains and estimate their amplification through intersectoral dependencies.  

## Key Notes
- Input data: IO, WP1 outage forecasts.  
- Main methods: ARIO framework with nonlinear propagation and stock adjustments.  
- Outputs: Economic loss time-series, sectoral multipliers, cross-country loss patterns.
